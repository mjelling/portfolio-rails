        <h3>Professionally</h3>
        <p> Hey there!  Thanks for taking the time to view my portfolio.  I'm a full-stack web developer trained in building robust applications
          using the Node.js as Ruby-on-rails frameworks. I currently code in ruby and javascript, I use jQuerry and AngularJS to expand the functionality of
          javascript.  I also am proficient working with both sql and nosql database schemes. And I use a number of frameworks to get the most out of
          the front-end styling of my applications. I'm always looking for new opportunities in web-development.  I'm currently open
          to full-time work as a web developer in house for established companies, start-ups, and dev-shops. Also, if you
          like my work, I accept offers freelance projects.
        </p>

        <h3>Personally</h3>
        <p> I was born and raised in New Jersey in the shadow of New York City in 1989. Upon completing
          high school, I moved to Greenwhich Village and began a degree in politics, graduating with a
          B.S. in 2015. Except for a year and a half spent in Israel, New York has been my home ever since.
          I love the outdoors, but am eqully passionate about music, film, and reading (both fiction and non-fiction).
          In highschool I was the captain of my track team and love running to this day.  I'm a huge believer
          that one should never stop learning, and strive to constantly build upon my knowledge and skills.
          Ask me about my favorite books and films, where I've traveled, or anything else.
